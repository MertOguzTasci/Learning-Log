# Learning Log

Learning Log is a web application that allows users to
log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and make journal entries as
they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page will
describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once
logged in, a user can create new topics, add new entries, and read
and edit existing entries.

# Features

User Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in to access their learning logs.
Topic Tracking: Users can create new topics they're learning about and add entries to each topic.
Timestamps: Entries are automatically timestamped to keep track of when they were added.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
